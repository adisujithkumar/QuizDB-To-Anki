# QuizDB-To-Anki
Welcome to the QuizDB To Anki repository! Quizdb.org is a website online, created by Raynor Kuang, which databases thousands of quiz bowl questions of varying difficulty for people around the world to easily access. Therefore, it is a easy resource quiz bowl players use to learn and improve at quiz bowl. However, due to the nature of quizdb.org, downloading the questions into a csv file downloads the question as a whole. I found it more efficient to split the paragraph-long question up into its individual sentences such that each sentence would be given an indivudal flashcard in a flashcard program, such as Anki. By splitting the question up, retainment of new clues and facts is much more efficient. Separating the questions into sentences can take hours by hand. Thus, I created this python script to automate the process. It should take in a csv file downloaded/converted from quizdb.org and spit out a csv file (separated by sentences) ready to input to Anki.
