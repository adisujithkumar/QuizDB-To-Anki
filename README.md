# QuizDB-To-Anki
The python file in this repo should allow the user to convert csv files downloaded/converted from quizdb.org into a csv for use in a flashcard program, such as Anki. The file should split up the paragraph long question such that each sentence gets a separate flashcard. This way separating clues and studying for QB can now be more efficient.
